# Screen-Guide for Windows
Screen guide is a semi-transparent, sizable, moveable, coloured window that has two uses.

1. It can be used as a screen guide to help you focus on certain areas of your screen.
2. It can be used as a colour filter. There is also a grey option if you want to tone down the glare of a bright screen in situations where you can't access the settings (for example a public computer).

I know it works on Windows 10 but haven't tested it on earlier versions.
